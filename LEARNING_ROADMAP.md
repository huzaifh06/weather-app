# Weather App Learning Roadmap

## üéØ Project Overview
You'll build a weather tracking application with a Streamlit frontend, SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM, and Alembic for database migrations. This roadmap provides a structured learning path without giving you all the answers.

## üìã Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for web interface)
- **Database**: SQLite (lightweight, file-based database)
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping)
- **Migrations**: Alembic (database migration tool for SQLAlchemy)
- **API Integration**: OpenWeatherMap API (for weather data)
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler (for automated data collection)

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path & Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Foundation (Day 1-2)
**Goal**: Set up basic project structure and understand core concepts

#### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Create virtual environment
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with essential packages
- [ ] Understand package dependencies and their purposes

**Key Learning Questions**:
- What is a virtual environment and why use it?
- How do you manage Python dependencies?

#### 1.2 Project Structure Planning
- [ ] Design folder structure (models, config, main app)
- [ ] Understand separation of concerns in application architecture

**Recommended Structure**:
```
myweatherapp/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models.py          # Database models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py          # Configuration settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weather_api.py     # Weather API integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py           # Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scheduler.py      # Background data collection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ alembic.ini      # Alembic configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ alembic/         # Migration files
```

### Phase 2: Database Foundation (Day 2-3)
**Goal**: Understand SQLAlchemy ORM and database design

#### 2.1 SQLAlchemy Basics

- [ ] Understand SQLAlchemy declarative base
- [ ] Create your first model class

**Key Learning Points**:
- What is an ORM and its benefits?
- How do Python classes map to database tables?
- What are primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships?

#### 2.2 Database Models Design
- [ ] Design `WeatherData` model (think about what fields you need)
- [ ] Design `TrackedCity` model (for managing which cities to track)
- [ ] Understand column types and constraints

**Learning Challenge**: 
What fields would you need to store weather information? Consider data types, required vs optional fields, and relationships between models.

### Phase 3: Database Migrations with Alembic (Day 3-4)
**Goal**: Master database versioning and migrations

#### 3.1 Alembic Setup
- [ ] Initialize Alembic in your project
- [ ] Understand the alembic.ini configuration file
- [ ] Learn about migration environments

**Key Concepts**:
- Why are database migrations important?
- How does version control work for databases?
- What happens when you deploy to production?

#### 3.2 Creating and Running Migrations
- [ ] Generate your first migration for WeatherData table
- [ ] Run migrations to create actual database
- [ ] Add TrackedCity table via a new migration
- [ ] Practice adding/modifying columns

**Learning Exercise**:
Try adding a new field to one of your models and create a migration for it.

### Phase 4: API Integration (Day 4-5)
**Goal**: Connect to external weather service

#### 4.1 Weather API Understanding
- [ ] Sign up for OpenWeatherMap API
- [ ] Understand API endpoints and parameters
- [ ] Learn about API keys and rate limiting

**Key Questions**:
- How do you handle API errors gracefully?
- What happens when the API is unavailable?
- How do you manage sensitive information like API keys?

#### 4.2 API Integration Implementation
- [ ] Create weather data fetching function
- [ ] Handle different response scenarios (success, city not found, network error)
- [ ] Parse JSON responses and extract needed data

**Challenge**: 
How would you test your API integration without making actual API calls during development?

### Phase 5: Data Storage and Management (Day 5-6)
**Goal**: Connect API data to database

#### 5.1 Database Operations
- [ ] Create database session management
- [ ] Implement CRUD operations for both models
- [ ] Handle database connections properly (opening/closing sessions)

**Learning Focus**:
- How do you manage database connections in a web application?
- What are database sessions and why are they important?
- How do you handle database errors?

#### 5.2 Data Collection Logic
- [ ] Create functions to fetch and store weather data
- [ ] Implement city management (add/remove cities to track)
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling

### Phase 6: Background Data Collection (Day 6-7)
**Goal**: Automate weather data collection

#### 6.1 Scheduling Concepts
- [ ] Understand why you need background tasks
- [ ] Learn about APScheduler and different scheduler types
- [ ] Implement periodic data collection

**Key Learning**:
- How do you run tasks in the background?
- What happens if a scheduled task fails?
- How do you prevent duplicate data collection?

#### 6.2 Production Considerations
- [ ] Handle application startup and shutdown
- [ ] Implement logging for monitoring
- [ ] Consider what happens when the app restarts

- How do you handle invalid user input?
- What if the weather API changes its response format?

## üîß Development Tools and Workflow

### Essential Commands You'll Learn
- Database migrations: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"`
- Running migrations: `alembic upgrade head`
- Starting Streamlit: `streamlit run main.py`

## üéì Learning Objectives by Phase

**Phase 1-2**: Understand project structure and basic database concepts
**Phase 3-4**: Master migrations and external API integration
**Phase 5-6**: Learn data management and background processing
**Phase 7-8**: Build user interfaces and connect all components

## üí° Key Learning Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality, then add complexity
2. **Test Early**: Test each component as you build it
3. **Read Documentation**: Get comfortable with official docs for each tool
4. **Handle Errors**: Always think about what could go wrong
5. **Iterate**: Build, test, refine, repeat

## ü§î Self-Assessment Questions

After each phase, ask yourself:
- Can I explain this concept to someone else?
- What would happen if I changed this part of the code?
- How would this scale with more data or users?
- What are the potential failure points?

## üöÄ Next Steps After Completion

Once you've built the basic app, consider these enhancements:
- Add user authentication
- Implement caching for API responses
- Add more weather metrics (humidity, pressure, etc.)
- Create email alerts for extreme weather
- Deploy to cloud platforms
- Add unit and integration tests

---

Remember: This roadmap is your learning journey. Take time to understand each concept thoroughly before moving on. The goal is not just to build the app, but to understand the underlying principles that make it work.

Good luck with your Python learning adventure! üêç
